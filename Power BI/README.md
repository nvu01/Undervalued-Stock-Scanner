# Power BI Data Modeling and Visualization

This part of Undervalued Stock Scanner project uses Microsoft Power BI to create data models for result Excel workbooks (in V3) and generate interactive data visualizations. The goal is to provide insights and industry comparisons using the data from these workbooks.

## Important Files

The Power BI folder contains the following key files:

- **Data Model_Result Excel Workbooks.pbix**: Power BI file for creating a data model from the Excel workbooks in V3\Results folder. This model organizes the data and establishes relationships for better analysis.
  
- **Industry Averages Report.pbix**: Power BI file that includes data visualizations based on industry averages, using the data models created from the Excel workbooks.

- **Evaluating Industries.pdf**: A PDF guide that explains how to interpret and analyze the visualizations in `Data Visualization_Industry Averages.pbix`.

- **Using Industry Averages Report.pdf**: A PDF guide providing step-by-step instructions on how to interact with the `Data Visualization_Industry Averages.pbix` file in Power BI.

## How to Use the Files

1. **Open Power BI Desktop** and load the `.pbix` files:
   - Open `Data Model_Excel Workbooks.pbix` to view and modify the data model.
   - Open `Industry Averages Report.pbix` to explore the visualizations. 

2. **Interpreting Visualizations**:
   - Refer to the `Evaluating Industries.pdf` for a guide on how to understand the data and what insights can be drawn from the visualizations.

3. **Interacting with the Visualizations**:
   - Use the filters, slicer, and charts in the `Data Visualization_Industry Averages.pbix` file. For detailed instructions, refer to the `Using Industry Averages Report.pdf`.

## Requirements
